- In this tutorial I have explained how we can build and deploy sklearn model with own custom script in Sagemaker environment. 

### Steps that we followed!

1. Initialize Boto3 SDK and create S3 bucket. 
2. Upload data in Sagemaker Local Storage. 
3. Data Exploration and Understanding.
4. Split the data into Train/Test CSV File. 
5. Upload data into the S3 Bucket.
6. Create a Training Script
7. Train script inside Sagemaker container. 
8. Store Model Artifacts(model.tar.gz) into the S3 Bucket. 
9. Deploy Sagemaker Endpoint(API) for the trained model, and test it.
